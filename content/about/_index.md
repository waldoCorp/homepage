waldoCorp is not (yet) a registered corporation, but its the name Ben and Lief picked as an umbrella for various projects. Its named for Waldo, an adorable cat who started life in a college dorm room, and now is the Queen of Ben's apartment. Easy Match is our first product, and we hope to create more cool things in the future.
