# [Scheduler](https://schedule.waldocorp.com/)

Born out of Ben needing to efficiently schedule his group in lab during the COVID shutdown, the [Scheduler](https://schedule.waldocorp.com/) is designed to efficiently allocate time in a given room based on people's requests for that space. It can be configured to account for different amounts of room capacity as well as to preferentially schedule people when they would prefer (e.g. mornings or afternoons).
